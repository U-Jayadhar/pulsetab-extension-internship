# pulsetab-extension-internship

Welcome to the **pulsetab-extension-internship** repository! This project is part of my internship journey, focused on developing a browser extension. It serves as a dedicated space for learning and experimenting with backend technologies that will be integral to the main project.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is my **personal learning ground** for exploring and integrating Firebase technologies needed for the development of a fully functional browser extension.

## 🧠 Learning Scope

Technologies & Services I'm exploring:

* **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL Database)
* **Firebase Authentication** (User login & session management)
* **Firebase Hosting** (Serving web assets)
* **Firebase Storage** (Storing media and files)

Focus areas:

* Setting up and configuring Firebase services
* Managing user data securely
* Connecting the backend with a frontend interface

## 📌 Notes

* This is **not a production-level project**. It's a **learning and prototyping** space where I’m actively experimenting with tools and best practices.
* Expect frequent updates and changes as I continue to learn and iterate.

## 📍 Steps

* Setting up a Firebase project. ✅
* Firestore Datbase. ✅
* Google OAuth. ✅
* Hosting. ✅

* Functions. ⏳
* Begin testing integrations. ⏳
