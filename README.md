# pulsetab-extension-internship

Welcome to the **pulsetab-extension-internship** repository! This is a learning space created as part of an internship focused on developing a browser extension project. The repository is structured to help explore and build proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies that will be essential for the main project.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo serves as a **learning ground** for technologies and tools required in the actual browser extension development. It is split into two branches:

- `main` → for **frontend** learning and experiments
- `backend` → for **backend** learning and setup

## 🧠 Learning Scope

### 🌐 Frontend (main branch)

Technologies & Tools:

- **HTML & CSS / SCSS**
- **Bootstrap** (for responsive UI components)
- **Angular** (SPA framework)
- **TypeScript** (strongly-typed JavaScript)

Focus:

- Building user interfaces
- Understanding Angular architecture
- Styling with Bootstrap and SCSS


### 🔧 Backend (backend branch)

Technologies & Services:

- **Firebase Firestore** (NoSQL Database)
- **Firebase Authentication** (User login & session management)
- **Firebase Hosting** (Serving web assets)
- **Firebase Storage** (Storing media and files)

Focus:

- Setting up and integrating Firebase services
- Managing user data securely
- Backend interaction with frontend

## 📁 Branch Structure

| Branch    | Purpose                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| `main`    | Frontend experiments            |
| `backend` | Backend configuration and logic |

## 📌 Notes

- This is **not a production repo** — it's intended solely for **learning, prototyping, and exploring** tools and frameworks.
- The structure and content may change frequently as part of ongoing learning.

## 📍 Next Steps

- Set up Angular CLI and start a basic UI in the `main` branch.
- Initialize Firebase project and test integrations in the `backend` branch.
